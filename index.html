  <p>Primer3 is a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22primer3%22&btnG=&as_sdt=0%2C5">widely used</a> 
     program for designing PCR primers (PCR = "Polymerase Chain Reaction").  PCR is an essential and ubiquitous 
     tool in genetics and molecular biology</a>.  Primer3 can also design hybridization probes and sequencing primers.
  </p>

  <p>PCR is used for many different goals.  Consequently, primer3 has many different input parameters that you control 
     and that tell primer3 exactly what characteristics make good primers for your goals.
  </p>

  <p>Primer3 -- the C code, the web interface, and the documentation --  are an open source, community-development 
     project hosted by <a href="https://github.com/primer3-org">GitHub</a>.
